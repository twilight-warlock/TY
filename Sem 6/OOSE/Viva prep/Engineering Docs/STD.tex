\section{Introduction}
\subsection{System overview}
The website centers around creating a social space for students to write blogs on almost any interest of their own. Every blog post will have a like and dislike button and a comment section allowing discussions under that blog.
The website will have a landing portal(home page) which will have links to register and a login page. The website will not allow any unregistered users to post blogs or like, dislike or comment on the blogs. While registering, students will be asked to fill details appropriate for the website to increase connectivity.
There will be a profile page displaying all the details of a student like his/her name, their bio, skill-set, stream of education, experience(if applicable, in internships). Said profile page will also allow users to connect other social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and also display their Github profile.

\par 
Our website contains many forms for clients to fill. As we cannot control the input, we have proper validation code to ensure correct information gets sent to the database and that the new information gets displayed on the website. The focus of testing will be these forms as, if some malicious data gets entered into the forms it could affect the normal working of the database.
    
\subsection{Test approach}
To check if the website is able to stop incorrect input from getting to the database, we will be testing the forms manually. Repeated testing will be done to ensure that the website is able to work regardless of different types of input.
We will be going through the forms on the website such as Sign up, Login, Create profile, Add education, Add experience, posts and testing them manually with valid as well as invalid data. The constraints we will be facing is the deadline of submission.
\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
Unit testing, a testing technique using which individual modules are tested
to determine if there are any issues by the developer himself. It is concerned
with functional correctness of the standalone modules. Unit Testing is done
during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers.
Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be
an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.
\subsubsection{White Box testing}
White Box Testing is software testing technique in which internal structure,
design and coding of software are tested to verify flow of input-output and to
improve design, usability and security. In white box testing, code is visible to
testers so it is also called Clear box testing, Open box testing, Transparent
box testing, Code-based testing and Glass box testing. White box testing
techniques analyze the internal structures, the used data structures, internal
design, code structure and the working of the software rather than just the
functionality as in black box testing. It is also called glass box testing or
clear box testing or structural testing.
\subsubsection{Black Box testing}
Black box testing is a method of software testing that tests the functionality
of an application as opposed to its internal structures of working. Specific
knowledge of applicationâ€™s code/internal structure and programming knowl-
edge in general is not required. The tester is only aware of what the software
is supposed to do, but not how i.e. When he/she enters a certain input,
he/she gets a certain output; without being aware of how the output was
produced in the first place. Test cases are built around specifications and
requirements i.e. what the application is supposed to do. It uses external de-
scriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements and design
to derive test cases.

\section{Test plan}
The objectives supported by the Test Plan are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To test the project such that it meets the business and user require-
	ments.
	 \item The Test Plan should find defects which may get created by the pro-
	 grammer while developing the software.
	\item To make sure that the end result is correct.
	\item Testing can be helpful in gaining confidence in and providing informa-
	tion about the level of quality.
\end{itemize}

The major functions and scopes that would be tested are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Login Module
	 \item Registration Module
\end{enumerate}
Following points to be considered while testing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Perform unit testing on individual modules
	\item Integrate the modules to perform the integration testing after successful
	completion of unit testing.
	\item Then, the system as a whole will be tested and we will perform the
	system testing.
	\item Different scenarios that can occur once the project will be deployed has
	been considered for ensuring effective testing of the software.
\end{itemize}


The testing of the website will cover how the website is able to handle different types of inputs, showing messages: error and success as well as the data displayed on the website. Repeated manual testing of th forms will done changing the input at every iteration. 
The items that will tested are the forms as well as other functionality like deleting posts, comments and editing profile. Dummy data will be used to test forms as well as deleting that dummy data from the website.
